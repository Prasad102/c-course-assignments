First two inputs are input and output temperature scales from below list:
{"°C", "c", "C", "celsius", "Celsius", "°F", "f", "F", "fahrenheit", "Fahrenheit", "k", "K", "kelvin", "Kelvin"}

From third input onwards, you need to give multiple numbers as input for temperature conversion separated by space.
